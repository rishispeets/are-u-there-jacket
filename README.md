I needed a new winter jacket, but for some reason, the jacket I wanted kept dissapearing from Uniqlo's website. Since I value my time so much, I build this scraper.

The Lambda accepts a url and a string containing search terms. It performs a fuzzy search(-ish), and returns the products matching the search terms, from highest to lowest relevance.

You can pair the Lambda with something like AWS CloudWatch for regular scrapes, or AWS API Gateway if you need an endpoint.

Right after I started building this, I bought a different jacket. May that serve as a lesson to myself never to build silly things like this again.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Usage

```
npm install -g serverless
sls deploy
```
## API

Example of a valid Lambda event argument:

```JSON
{
  "url": "https://www.uniqlo.com/eu/en/men/outerwear/coats-jackets/wool-coats",
  "searchTerms": "wool coat"
}
```
